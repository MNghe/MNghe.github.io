        <div class=box>
            <p> This project presents a MATLAB graphical user interface based approach to filter the three planes of a
                3-dimensional image array. The project explores the idea of manipulating a particular matrix, along with
                exploring methods to make it user friendly for importing and exporting images.

                <img src="Matlab Projs/RGB Filter/Images/Original.jpg"
                    style="float: right; width: 100px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; padding: 0px; padding-left: 20px;">
                Through observation after loading an image into MATLAB through the imread function, I found that the
                Original.jpg was represented as a 640x640x3 array. Then the realization came that the 3 signifies the
                Red, Green, Blue color values. After experimenting with masking the image, the idea came where I may be
                able to adjust specific sections of the array.

                The first objective is seeing how possible it is to influence the arrays' values, which eventually came
                to converting the partial matrix into zero. To see the full impact, I made sure to create three separate
                identical arrays in which I adjusted a particular matrix for each that would filter out the Red, Green,
                and Blue respectively. To accomplish this, I installed an Image Processing Toolbox to perform image
                processing and analysis. Once that was finished, I used the tight_subplot function to close the gaps
                between the figures and found a way to make the image importing process easier for other users.

                By typing 'guide' into the command window of MATLAB, we open the developor's environment to visually
                create the GUI along with adjusting the design and tags of each component. Making custom tags for each
                component made it easier to keep track of each button's function when programming. An issue occurred
                where the toggle states were not being registered until all three toggles have been changed, an easy
                solution to this was to set an initial value for these global variables.
