        Filtering the RGB in an Image through MATLAB GUI

        <div class=box>
            <p> This project presents a MATLAB graphical user interface based approach to filter the three planes of a
                3-dimensional image array. The project explores the idea of manipulating a particular matrix, along with
                exploring methods to make it user friendly for importing and exporting images.

                <img src="Matlab Projs/RGB Filter/Images/Original.jpg"
                    style="float: right; width: 100px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; padding: 0px; padding-left: 20px;">
                Through observation after loading an image into MATLAB through the imread function, I found that the
                Original.jpg was represented as a 640x640x3 array. Then the realization came that the 3 signifies the
                Red, Green, Blue color values. After experimenting with masking the image, the idea came where I may be
                able to adjust specific sections of the array.

                The first objective is seeing how possible it is to influence the arrays' values, which eventually came
                to converting the partial matrix into zero. To see the full impact, I made sure to create three separate
                identical arrays in which I adjusted a particular matrix for each that would filter out the Red, Green,
                and Blue respectively. Once that was finished, I used the tight_subplot function to close the gaps
                between the figures and found a way to make the image importing process easier for other users.

                For a test run, an initial script is created that does the entire process all in one run with a specific
                amount of samples to collect. A major setback during this process was the MATLAB's fopen function that
                claimed the ports were not available, this is because the script may encounter bugs midway through the
                process and the program did not make it to the end where it would close all ports. Due to this, MATLAB
                had to be restarted after each failed run in order to test new solutions. Once this was completed, the
                next objective to work on the MATLAB GUI using GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Development Environment).

                By typing 'guide' into the command window of MATLAB, we open the developor's environment to visually
                create the GUI along with adjusting the design and tags of each component. Making custom tags for each
                component made it easier to keep track of each button's function when programming. An issue that was
                encountered here was the Collect toggle button, where the process occurs in a 'while loop.' While
                debugging, I noticed while stepping in is that the program skips checking if the while condition is
                still true. Thus a pause function is used to all the program to check if any button functions were
                called.

                While running the Export button multiple times, I noticed that some old data/cells were still visible.
                Eventually coming to realize that it was not an old array that was not cleared, rather, the Export
                button overwrites whatever it can, meaning anything beyond the range of my array is still kept in those
                cells. A simple solution to this for if anyone wanted a clean Excel file with just the most recent data,
                I made a delete button to delete the related Excel file so that the old data does not conflict/mix with
                the new one.
