        Creating The Website From NOTHING!

        <div class=box>
            <p>
                Let's start with the Why first. Why did I make this website? As I applied to jobs, it felt like the
                resume
                was
                lacking, not the content specifically, but that it should not present who I am. Thus I decided to tackle
                this
                issue by learning and creating a website with my ability to learn!
                <br><br>
                This also served as an oppertunity I created on my own, to learn Figma, HTML, CSS, and UX & UI
                designing!
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class=domain>
        <h1> USING FIGMA </h1>
        <div class=box>
            <p>
                <img src="How Images/figma_logo.png"
                    style="float: left; width: 30%; background-color: cornsilk; margin-right: 20px;" />
                How it first started was with the use of Figma to design the layout of the website. It was also
                discovered
                that
                there was a plugin for Figma that would convert Figma into HTML and CSS, however the conversion was not
                as
                great
                as anticpated. This led to learning HTML and CSS on my own to create the desired design.

    <div class=domain>
        <h1> GITHUB PAGES</h1>
        <div class=box>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
                <img src="How Images/github.PNG" style="float: left; width: 60%" />
                The next step is to get your own domain name that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority,
                or
                control within the Internet. Since I plan to not buy a domain name, I used GitHub's Pages to create a
                repository
                that would hold my files.
                <br><br>
                Now that the idea is set, preperations are made, the next step is creating! With the use of Visual
                Studio
                Code
                as the IDE, the website is born! Since <a href="https://github.com/MNghe/MNghe.github.io"
                    style="color: cyan;">my GitHub
                    repository</a> is public, anyone can be able to copy the code I've
                written and create their own variation of this website! In life, it is important to share and help each
                other so
                that society can progress faster!
