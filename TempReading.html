        <div class=box>
            <p> This project presents a MATLAB graphical user interface based approach to save real time process data
                obtained
                from a temperature sensor. The GUI allows the user to graphically view the temperature variation at the
                end of
                the sensor data acquisition. As for the temperature reading, it will be in Centigrade (Celsius).

                The first step in this project is to have a sensor to log data, this is done with an ELEGOO Uno R3
                (Similiar to an Arduino Uno), that is connected to a thermistor (A resistance thermometer / A resistor
                whose resistance is dependent on temperature). There is also a resistor (10k Ohms) in the circuit
                design, it is based on the resistance of the thermistor.

                After the setup is the programming process. At the beginning of this project, I used the Web Editor
                version of the Arduino IDE. However I experienced port connection issues, eventually leading to getting
                the actual Arduino IDE (A free IDE). As for the code, it was found online. The code is in the (link
                this) GitHub repository
                with the original owner's comments.

                Like the Arduino Web Editor, I tried using the MATLAB Web Editor and it did not connect well. Thus, the
                actual software was downloaded, along with a plugin to help with the connection of the Arduino hardware.

                For a test run, an initial script is created that does the entire process all in one run with a specific
                amount of samples to collect. A major setback during this process was the MATLAB's fopen function that
                claimed the ports were not available, this is because the script may encounter bugs midway through the
                process and the program did not make it to the end where it would close all ports. Due to this, MATLAB
                had to be restarted after each failed run in order to test new solutions. Once this was completed, the
                next objective to work on the MATLAB GUI using GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Development Environment).

                By typing 'guide' into the command window of MATLAB, we open the developor's environment to visually
                create the GUI along with adjusting the design and tags of each component. Making custom tags for each
                component made it easier to keep track of each button's function when programming. An issue that was
                encountered here was the Collect toggle button, where the process occurs in a 'while loop.' While
                debugging, I noticed while stepping in is that the program skips checking if the while condition is
                still true. Thus a pause function is used to all the program to check if any button functions were
                called.

                While running the Export button multiple times, I noticed that some old data/cells were still visible.
                Eventually coming to realize that it was not an old array that was not cleared, rather, the Export
                button overwrites whatever it can, meaning anything beyond the range of my array is still kept in those
                cells. A simple solution to this for if anyone wanted a clean Excel file with just the most recent data,
                I made a delete button to delete the related Excel file so that the old data does not conflict/mix with
                the new one.
