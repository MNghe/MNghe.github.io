        Why I Did It

    <div class=about>
        Let's start with the Why first. Why did I make this website? As I applied to jobs, it felt like the resume was
        lacking, not the content specifically, but that it should not present who I am. Thus I decided to tackle this
        issue by learning and creating a website with my ability to learn!
        <br><br>
        This also served as an oppertunity I created on my own, to learn Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UX & UI
        designing!

    <div class=about>
        How it first started was with the use of Figma to design the layout of the website. It was also discovered that
        there was a plugin for Figma that would convert Figma into HTML and CSS, however the conversion was not as great
        as anticpated. This led to learning HTML and CSS on my own to create the desired design.

        The next step is to get your own domain name that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or
        control within the Internet. Since I plan to not buy a domain name, I used GitHub's Pages to create a repository
        that would hold my files.

        Now that the idea is set, preperations are made, the next step is creating! With the use of Visual Studio Code
        as the IDE, the website is born! Since <a href = "https://github.com/MNghe/MNghe.github.io">my GitHub repository</a> is public, anyone can be able to copy the code I've
        written and create their own variation of this website! In life, it is important to share and help each other so
        that society can progress faster!

        As more projects are added and better design ideas come about, there will be further changes to the website! It
        is always important to express your creativity through different mediums!
